/**
 * a coroutine is an instance of suspendable computation.
 * a block of code to run that works concurrently with the rest of the code.
 *
 * a coroutine is not bound to any particular thread.
 * It may suspend its execution in one thread and resume in another one.
 *
 * runBlocking = coroutine builder, bridges between
 * the non-coroutine world of a regular and
 * the code with coroutines inside of its block.
 *
 * the thread that runs it (in this case â€” the main thread) gets blocked for the duration of the call,
 * until all the coroutines inside runBlocking { ... } complete their execution
 *
 * launch = coroutine builder, declared only in the CoroutineScope
 *
 * delay = special suspending function
 *
 * Coroutines follow a principle of structured concurrency which means that
 * new coroutines can be only launched in a specific CoroutineScope which
 * delimits the lifetime of the coroutine
 *
 * This ensures that they are not lost and do not leak.
 * An outer scope cannot complete until all its children coroutines complete
 *
 * runBlocking is a regular function and coroutineScope is a suspending function.
